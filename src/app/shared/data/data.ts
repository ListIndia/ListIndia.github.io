    "location": "Pune, Maharashtra",
    "description": "Toughened glass or tempered glass is glass that has undergone processes of controlled thermal treatment to increase its strength. It is four times stronger than normal annealed glass. Toughened glass is made from annealed glass that has been heated to approximately 650???C and then rapidly cooled. Due to the increased heat treatment and rapid cooling of the glass, the treatment produces different physical properties. This results in compressive stress on the surface and improved bending strength of glass. Before toughening, the glass must be cut to size or pressed to shape.Characteristics of Toughened Glass: Toughening does not alter the basic characteristics of glass like light transmission and solar radiant heat properties of normal glass. It can neither be cut, nor altered. Toughened glass is known to have higher thermal strength, with the ability to withstand high temperature changes up to 250&deg;C. A safety glass, toughened glass is difficult to break but in the event of a breakage, disintegrates into small globules . However, it is prone to very rare spontaneous breakage, a condition that occurs when the repeated heating and cooling cause the nickel sulfide stones to increase in size.Annealed Glass vs Toughened Glass:&nbsp; ParametersToughened GlassAnnealed GlassHeating TemperatureHeated to over 1,100 &deg;FHeated between 850 &deg;F and 900 &deg;FStrengthKnown for its strength and durability. Four times stronger than annealed glassBrittle and lacks enduranceBreakage PatternDoes not break easily; In the rare event of breakage, shatters into small, pebble-like piecesBreaks under pressure; Breakage results in dangerous, jagged edgesSafetyOffers greater safety due to its resilienceRelatively unsafe due to its delicate natureFlexibilityCan&rsquo;t be altered after temperingCan be cut, drilled, or polishedApplication areaAppropriate for high-traffic areasInappropriate for high-traffic areasDistortion TypeBow & Warp Distortion Can OccurFree from Bow, Wave or Warp Distortion&nbsp;The Process of Toughening: First, the glass is carried by rollers and goes through the furnace. Here, three types of modes are used to heat the glass, viz., conduction, convection and radiation. While the rollers help to conduct the heat, the coils enable radiation of heat. This ensures that the glass is evenly heated on every side. By blasting air on both the surfaces, the heated glass is then cooled uniformly.Why the Need for Toughened Glass: &nbsp;Toughened Glass has high withstanding capacity and is therefore suitable for uses where strength and thermal resistance are crucial. It is nearly four to five times stronger than annealed glass, and thrice as strong as heat strengthened glass. Even during breakage, its relatively small pieces reduce the chances of injury. Toughened Glass is ideal in spider and point fixed glazing owing to its high edge strength tempered glass. Glass is susceptible to thermal breakage with drastic changes in temperature. This is more so when temperature rises above 32&deg;C, building up stress within the glass. But with toughened glass, there is significantly higher edge strength to resist thermal breakage.What makes Toughened Glass ideal for homes:&nbsp;Toughened Glass is the ideal solution for every space that demands the highest level of safety, and hence perfect for homes.",

    "description": "Welcome to the ultimate destination of Perfect interior &amp; Exterior Decoration of your Office, Home, Hotel, Industry &amp; Other Living Space. The main Purpose of interior design is to create a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing interior space. Contrary to popular belief; interior design is more than just decorating, although that is a part of it. In fact, designing the interior of a building begins well before it is even built. An interior designer is a type of designer that helps plan and decorate interior spaces in either commercial or residential spaces. As with many other professions, an interior designer will often specialize in a certain area of interior design. Interior designers make interior spaces functional, safe, and beautiful by determining space requirements and selecting decorative items, such as colors, lighting, and materials. They read blueprints and must be aware of building codes and inspection regulations .It&rsquo;s probably the least glamorous part of web design, but information design is by no means the least important. Locating and consuming information is the quintessential web tasks, far surpassing buying, playing and communicating, all of which include a good portion of information design themselves. How users find and then avail themselves of all that information is affected by how it is structured and presented. Thus every web designer should be equipped to make qualified and informed decisions on just how to do this. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to organize a bunch of stuff if you don&rsquo;t know what that stuff actually is. So your first task is to skim through the site&rsquo;s content, processes and goals. A site&rsquo;s content means copy, images, video and other assets you&rsquo;ve been given or briefed on that needs to go into the site. A site&rsquo;s processes are the tasks and workflows that users will need to complete to interact with a site. And the site&rsquo;s goals refer to both the client&rsquo;s goals and the user&rsquo;s.

    "description": "Sandblasting glass powder&nbsp;are a type of abrasive material used in sandblasting or abrasive blasting to clean, polish, and finish surfaces. These beads are made from high-quality, spherical glass and are ideal for applications where a gentle, non-destructive cleaning or finishing process is required. Due to their smooth, rounded shape, sandblasting glass beads provide an even, satin, or matte finish without scratching or damaging the underlying surface. Common uses include cleaning metal surfaces, removing rust or scale, preparing surfaces for coating or painting, and polishing delicate materials. Sandblasting glass beads are widely used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, and metalworking for their effectiveness, durability, and ability to provide a consistent finish.",

    "description": " Rapid Prototyping: CNC milling is widely used in the early stages of product development to create prototypes. It allows designers and engineers to quickly produce parts with high precision for testing and evaluation. Iterative Design: The process is highly flexible, enabling rapid adjustments to designs and quick iterations based on feedback.  2. Precision Manufacturing:   Complex Geometries: CNC milling services are ideal for producing parts with complex geometries, such as intricate contours, holes, slots, and threads. The automation of the process ensures high precision and repeatability. High Tolerance: CNC milling can achieve very tight tolerances (often within a few microns), making it suitable for industries that require extremely accurate parts, such as aerospace, medical, and automotive.  3. Aerospace Industry:   Complex Parts for Aircrafts: CNC milling is extensively used in the aerospace sector for creating complex components such as engine parts, brackets, and housings. It ensures that these parts are lightweight, durable, and meet stringent safety standards ",
