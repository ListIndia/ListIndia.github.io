    "description": " Rapid Prototyping: CNC milling is widely used in the early stages of product development to create prototypes. It allows designers and engineers to quickly produce parts with high precision for testing and evaluation. Iterative Design: The process is highly flexible, enabling rapid adjustments to designs and quick iterations based on feedback.  2. Precision Manufacturing:   Complex Geometries: CNC milling services are ideal for producing parts with complex geometries, such as intricate contours, holes, slots, and threads. The automation of the process ensures high precision and repeatability. High Tolerance: CNC milling can achieve very tight tolerances (often within a few microns), making it suitable for industries that require extremely accurate parts, such as aerospace, medical, and automotive.  3. Aerospace Industry:   Complex Parts for Aircrafts: CNC milling is extensively used in the aerospace sector for creating complex components such as engine parts, brackets, and housings. It ensures that these parts are lightweight, durable, and meet stringent safety standards ",
